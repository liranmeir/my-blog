1. create angular app using the angular-cli
   `ng new play-with-github-actions`
2. add `firebaserc & firebase.json` files to the root of the project
3. add to root folder `github/workflows/`<b>main.yml</b>

```json
// .firebaserc
{
  "projects": {
    "default": "liranmeir-actions"
  }
}
```

```json
// firebase.json
{
  "hosting": {
    "public": "dist/play-with-github-actions",
    "ignore": ["firebase.json", "**/.*", "**/node_modules/**"],
    "rewrites": [
      {
        "source": "**",
        "destination": "/index.html"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

```yaml
#  main.yml

name: CI-CD

# Controls when the action will run. Triggers the workflow on push or pull request
# events but only for the master branch
on:
  push:
    branches: [master]
  pull_request:
    branches: [master]

# A workflow run is made up of one or more jobs that can run sequentially or in parallel
jobs:
  # This workflow contains a single job called "build"
  build:
    # The type of runner that the job will run on
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    # Steps represent a sequence of tasks that will be executed as part of the job
    steps:
      # Checks-out your repository under $GITHUB_WORKSPACE, so your job can access it
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2

      - name: Use Node.js ${{ matrix.node-version }}
        uses: actions/setup-node@v1
        with:
          node-version: 12.x
      - name: install dependencies
        run: npm install
      - name: build
        run: npm run build
      - name: test
        run: npm run test-headless
      - name: Archive Production Artifact
        uses: actions/upload-artifact@master
        with:
          name: dist
          path: dist/play-with-github-actions
  deploy:
    name: Deploy
    needs: build
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout Repo
        uses: actions/checkout@master
      - name: Download Artifact
        uses: actions/download-artifact@master
        with:
          name: dist
          path: dist/play-with-github-actions
      - name: Deploy to Firebase
        uses: w9jds/firebase-action@master
        with:
          args: deploy --only hosting
        env:
          FIREBASE_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.FIREBASE_TOKEN }}
```

4. in the terminal hit `firebase login:ci`
5. then copy the `FIREBASE_TOKEN` and store it in your GitHub repo’s `settings>Secrets` section
6. Trigger a push/pull request and witness the pipeline being automated … Boom!!!
